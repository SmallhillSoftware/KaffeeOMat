***********************************************************************
The KaffeeOMat is a radio-controlled clock, with LCD. If you hit the
encoder, when the clock is synchronized to the radio provided DCF77-
signal, the current time is stored and displayed in a second row,
indicating time and date, when the last coffee was brewed.
It was created for the purpose to know in the office how long the
last brewed coffee resides in the coffeepot.
